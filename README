When QuickCheck finds a counterexample, it prints it out but
doesn't return it to the Haskell program. This can be annoying
when debugging.

This library provides a small extension to QuickCheck that returns
counterexamples as normal Haskell values. To use it, just import
Test.QuickCheck.Counterexamples instead of Test.QuickCheck.
The library is largely compatible with normal QuickCheck, but the
return types of quickCheck and related functions are changed to
include a counterexample.

Here is an example of getting counterexamples.
Suppose we have the following property:

prop_reverse_append :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Property
prop_reverse_append xs ys =
  reverse (xs++ys) === reverse xs ++ reverse ys

If we run QuickCheck on this property, it will return a counterexample:

> :t quickCheck prop_reverse_append
quickCheck prop_reverse_append :: IO (Maybe ([Int] :&: [Int] :&: ()))

The Maybe is there because we get Nothing if the property succeeds;
":&:" is a datatype of pairs.

Finally, if we run QuickCheck, we get the counterexample as a normal
Haskell value:

> Just (xs :&: ys :&: ()) <- quickCheck prop_reverse_append
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 5 tests and 4 shrinks):    
[0]
[1]
[1,0] /= [0,1]

> :t xs
xs :: [Int]

> xs
[0]

> ys
[1]
